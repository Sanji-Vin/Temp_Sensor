# Environmental Monitoring System  

This project is an **environmental monitoring system** built around the **ESP32-S3 Mini microcontroller**.  
It integrates multiple sensors on a custom PCB designed with **KiCad** and provides a **cross-platform monitoring application** built with **Flutter** for data visualization.  

## Features  
- 📟 **Custom PCB** with ESP32-S3 Mini, designed in KiCad  
- 🌡️ Temperature & humidity monitoring  
- 💡 Light intensity measurement  
- 🌫️ Air quality monitoring  
- 📡 Wi-Fi connectivity for real-time data transfer  
- 📊 Cross-platform Flutter app with:  
  - Interactive charts for sensor data  
  - Device status monitoring  
  - 24h data history  

## Technologies Used  
- **Hardware**:  
  - ESP32-S3 Mini  
  - I²C communication protocol  
  - KiCad for PCB design  
  - Integrated environmental sensors: -BME280 (temperature, Humidity sensor)
                                      -VEML7700(Light intensity sensor)
                                      -SGP40(air quality sensor)
      

- **Software**:  
  - Flutter for cross-platform app development  
  - Dart for frontend logic
